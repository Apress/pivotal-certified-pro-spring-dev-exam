== Building and Deploying
This is a Gradle multi-module project. The *-practice projects, have tests and pieces left unimplemented so building the full project using:
----
gradle build
----
will fail.

To build the full project and skipping tests, build from the root (`pet-sitter`) directory:
----
gradle build -x test
----

To build the project and ignore failed tests so you can get your full build status with Gradle Receipt, build from the root (`pet-sitter`) directory, using the following command:
----
gradle build -Dscan --continue
----
Just keep in mind, the project is quite big and when displaying the results, you browser might be slow.

== Observation

The ojdbc artifact is not available in Maven public repository.
There are two possible solutions:

* download it from the Official Oracle site and store it in the ~/.m2/repository/.. where Gradle is expecting to find it.
* in build.gradle replace this line:
----
ojdbc             : "com.oracle:ojdbc7:12.1.0.2",
----
with  this line:
----
ojdbc             : "com.github.noraui:ojdbc7:12.1.0.2.0"
----

I'm not sure how long the artifact will be available there (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.noraui/ojdbc7/12.1.0.2),
because Oracle licensing might prevent people from sharing their artifacts on public servers, so for long term use, the first solution is recommended.

== Releases

Release v1.0 corresponds to the code in the published book, without corrections or updates.

== Contributions

== Updates

The Gradle `build-scan` plugin is no longer available, so it was removed.
